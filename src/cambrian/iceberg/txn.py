"""Rollback primitive: ``restore_pointers`` — the one place ``Transaction._apply`` is used.

PyIceberg 0.11 ships ``Transaction._apply`` as a leading-underscore "private" method.
In practice it's been stable across the 0.x line and is the only API that can atomically
stage multiple ``TableUpdate``s with attached ``TableRequirement``s for a single REST
commit, which is exactly the property cambrian's rollback design depends on:

    Restore main, schema_id, spec_id, sort_order_id in ONE atomic catalog commit, with
    an AssertRefSnapshotId guard so a concurrent writer's commit between checkpoint and
    rollback can't silently clobber.

The public ``Transaction`` context-manager wraps the commit; only the *staging* of the
four-update payload requires ``_apply``. We isolate that call here so the rest of the
codebase has zero direct dependency on PyIceberg internals.

TODO(upstream): file a PyIceberg issue for a public ``Transaction.apply()`` (or accept
batch updates on the existing builder surface) so cambrian can drop the underscore.

INVARIANT: This module contains the ONLY call to ``Transaction._apply`` in cambrian.
``ripgrep '_apply\\b' src/`` should return exactly one match (the call below). New
multi-update-atomic operations must route through ``restore_pointers`` or a future
sibling in this module, not add their own private-API leak.

    commit time (because another writer advanced ``main``), the
    ``AssertRefSnapshotId`` requirement aborts the commit and this function raises
    ``ExternalWriteDetectedError``.

    The metadata-only case (table never had a snapshot, ``target_snapshot_id`` and
    ``expected_current_snapshot_id`` both ``None``) skips the snapshot-ref update and
    assertion — there's no ``main`` ref to restore — and only rolls back the three
    metadata pointers.

    snapshot) is degenerate: the checkpoint predates any append, but somehow appends
    have happened that we now want to undo by reverting to "before main existed". We
    refuse with ``IllegalStateError``: there's no safe semantics for "delete main" as
    part of a rollback and the caller almost certainly has a bug.
